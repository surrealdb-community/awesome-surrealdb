# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put things in the right category!
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
4. Do not use words that are clearly implied in the description, such as `for surrealdb`.
5. The description should be short (one sentence in 24 words, no expanded explanation) and meaningful without using emoji.
6. Do not use words that are not relevant to the description such as `Super-Fast` or `Super-Super-Fast`.
